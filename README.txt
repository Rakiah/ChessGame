## Synopsis

Source code for the chess game project you can see at Rakiah.com/Chess/


## Why ?

Initially started as a multiplayer chess game i decided after i finished gameplay
that it could be fun to try and make a little artificial intelligence to play against.
here is the result, i had no knowledge of AI algorithms so its kind of handmade and hardcoded,
but im not too dissapointed of the result, it may just have big troubles to end the game but atleast
the AI play instantly and you're not waiting for it :D
